## BFS  
For BFS traversal, it will traverse through the whole graph. The function will generate a corresponding BFS traverse map for all starting nodes.
 

## Kruskal 
We use Kruskal to return a minimum spanning tree, which has the "minimum effectiveness" (the minimum possible total edge weight) routes to every other node from a specific node. 

## MST 
We use MST. 

## Betweenness Centrality 
We use it.
