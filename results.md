## BFS  
For BFS traversal, it will traverse through the whole graph. The function will generate a corresponding BFS traverse map for all starting nodes.
 

## MST(Kruskal) 
We use Kruskal to return a minimum spanning tree, which has the "minimum effectiveness" (the minimum possible total edge weight) routes to every other node from a specific node. We use disjoint sets to implement the algorithm. Our Kruskal helper function returns a vector that contains all edges to connect the MST.


## Betweenness Centrality 
We use it to look for who is the most/least socially active author.
